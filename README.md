## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions > 3.8.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Python developer survey data from 2019 to better understand the role of Data Scientist:

1. Data Scientist need more experience than other roles?
2. In which business this role is more appreciated?
3. Which skills you will need the most?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook here to show the analysis performed

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to standardize cleaning and plot/hist for analysis.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](to arrive).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to JetBrains for the data.  You can find the data and the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
